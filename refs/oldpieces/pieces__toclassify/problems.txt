    p::load and show image should be saprated
        lasy load !
    f::load static test ok!
    p::can not dynamic load window!!??
    p::process bar! used in draw function , so , can not be del. imm.!
    f::when clean up gui , from end to start 
    p::can not bind with raw image variable ! Image class needed ! ref to tonemap
    f::may not show , just use the selection method without gui is ALSO acceptable!
    	gui should be changed this way . select method + open file 
    p::null pointer ?? debug!! use set / get function for classes 
    f::shared member? GLTexture object (just a ref based on name , data is sticked later!)
	GLTexture* texture(Image show)/FILE * filepointer (File processor)/
    p::texture and data should in a pair?? a bug??

    next steps?
	load texture from file/2darr
	share 2d array for image process, see stbi_load
		+hdr image processing 
		+segmentation (png)
		+medical imaging fMRI support
	share file pointer 
		+decide number of lines in a file
		+file size
